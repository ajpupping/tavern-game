6. Wraith: A spectral entity that drains the life force from living beings, difficult to hit with physical attacks.

## Weak but Troublesome

8. Giant Rats: Oversized vermin that can cause chaos and damage stocks, especially food supplies.

9. Kobold Squad: Weak individually but crafty and dangerous in groups, known for setting traps.

## Minor Threats
16. Ghost of a Former Patron: Not malevolent, but its presence spooks customers and disrupts business.

17. Barghest Pup: A young creature that can become invisible, it’s more scared than scary, accidentally causing trouble.

18. Imps: Small demonic beings causing mischief, stealing small items, and generally being a bother.

19. Magical Spider Webs: Non-lethal but suddenly appear to trap furniture and patrons alike, the result of a magical experiment gone wrong.
