# Event Name: The Wizard's Brew Request

## Event Description:
Representatives from the nearby wizard university approach you with a lucrative offer. Their faculty is hosting a grand party and they've heard tales of your tavern's exquisite ale. They wish to order several kegs of your finest brew for the occasion. Instead of traditional payment, they offer a temporary enchantment for your tavern. They promise to boost your profits for an unspecified amount of time. However, you're aware that deals with wizards can sometimes have unexpected outcomes.

## Player Choices:

### Accept the Enchantment Offer: 
Agree to the wizards' proposal and provide the ale in exchange for the enchantment.

### Negotiate for Payment Plus Enchantment: 
Attempt to negotiate for some gold now and the enchantment, highlighting the cost of producing such fine ale.

### Decline the Offer: 
Politely decline, insisting on traditional payment for the ale to avoid any magical entanglements.

## Choice Outcomes:

## Accept the Enchantment Offer:

### Immediate: 
The wizards are pleased and immediately enchant your tavern. The enchantment's effects are not immediately apparent.
### Long-term: 
Your tavern gains a magical allure, slightly increasing the number of patrons and the amount they're willing to spend. However, the enchantment occasionally causes minor, quirky magical mishaps (e.g., floating utensils).

## Negotiate for Payment Plus Enchantment:

### Immediate: 
Roll a digital dice to determine the outcome. 

#### High roll: 
The wizards agree to your terms. You receive a modest amount of gold and the enchantment, which boosts patronage and includes occasional, entertaining magical effects that delight guests.
#### Low roll: 
They are offended and withdraw their offer. You miss out on both the gold and potential enchantment benefits. If you roll a 1, they also curse your establishment as they leave.

## Decline the Offer:

#### Immediate: 
The wizards are disappointed but respect your decision. They take their business elsewhere.

### Long-term: 
You maintain your standard operations without any risk of magical complications. However, you hear tales of the wizard's party being a spectacular success, which could have increased your tavern's renown.

## Rewards/Penalties:

### Enchantment Offer Accepted: 
Increase in daily profits and occasional magical quirks that can be a talking point for patrons, but with a small risk of deterring the most superstitious customers.

### Successful Negotiation: 
Immediate gold gain and all the benefits of the enchantment without the quirks turning problematic.

### Negotiation Fails: 
Loss of both potential profits and magical benefits.

### Decline: 
Stability in your operations, but a missed opportunity for growth and recognition.

## Special Considerations:

This event can lead to a series of follow-up events related to the magical enchantment or the wizards' community, depending on the player's choices.

If enchanted, occasionally generate small, manageable events to showcase the tavern's new magical quirks. Add bonus to reward rolls.

If cursed, add disadvantage to all rolls.
