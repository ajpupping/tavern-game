# Event Name: Adventurers' Barter

## Event Description:
A rowdy group of adventurers bursts into your tavern. They're celebrating a recent victory but claim they're short on gold. Instead, they offer you a choice: a curious magical object they found on their last quest or a promise of a share in their profits from their next adventure. 

## Player Choices:

### Accept the Magical Object: 
Take the mysterious item as payment.

### Negotiate for Future Profits: 
Agree to the deal, but only if they promise a significant share of their next quest's rewards.

### Decline the Offer: 
Politely refuse their offer and suggest they return when they have the means to pay.

## Choice Outcomes:

### Accept the Magical Object:
Immediate: You receive a random magical item that can either be used to enhance the tavern or sold for gold.
Long-term: The item may attract other adventurers who wish to see or buy it.

### Negotiate for Future Profits:

#### Immediate: 
The adventurers agree reluctantly, promising you a larger share.
#### Long-term: 
After some time, you receive a substantial amount of gold. However, there's a small chance they fail their quest, resulting in no payment.

### Decline the Offer:

#### Immediate: 
The adventurers leave disappointed, but you maintain your tavern's policy of fair business.
#### Long-term: 
Your reputation for fairness increases slightly among the local population, possibly attracting more patrons.

## Rewards/Penalties:

### Magical Object: 
Gain a unique item with potential benefits or sale value.

### Future Profits: 
Gain a significant amount of gold later, with a risk of receiving nothing.

### Decline: 
Small boost to tavern reputation.

## Special Considerations:

The magical object's effects or value should be determined by dice roll.

The object should be added to the player's inventory, where they can decide to use or sell it.
