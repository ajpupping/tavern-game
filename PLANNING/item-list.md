# Items 

## Worthless
1. Broken Wand: A wand that sparks and sputters but canâ€™t perform any magic, though it might convince someone it's still powerful.

## Negative Effects
2. Cursed Coin: Appears valuable but brings minor misfortune to anyone who possesses it.

3. Gloves of Fumbling: Gives the wearer butterfingers, making it difficult to hold onto anything securely.

4. Pendant of Procrastination: Makes the wearer feel like they can put off any task until later, often leading to uncompleted tasks.

5. Belt of Hindsight: Offers brilliant insights and solutions, but only after the problem could have been solved or avoided.

## Silly
6. Hat of Disguise: When worn, it can change the wearer's appearance, but only into different styles and colors of mustaches.

7. Boots of False Tracks: Leaves tracks that confuse the wearer, causing them to walk in circles.

8. Mug of Endless Ale: Always refills with ale after being emptied, but the ale tastes slightly different each time.

9. Singing Sword: A sword that sings loudly (and off-key) when drawn, often embarrassing its wielder.

10. Scroll of Illusory Script: Makes the user's handwriting appear beautifully elegant, but only to the user. To everyone else, it's utterly illegible.



## Valuable
11. Amulet of the Planeswalker: A rare item that allows the user to teleport to a location they have previously visited.

12. Phoenix Feather Quill: Writes with ink that glows like fire. Anything written with it becomes indelible and cannot be erased or smudged.

13. Orb of Future Sight: Grants the user visions of possible future events once per week, though the interpretations are often vague.

14. Dagger of Venom: A beautifully crafted dagger that can coat itself in deadly poison, highly sought after by assassins.

15. Staff of Healing: Has the ability to heal minor wounds completely, and can significantly aid in recovering from serious injuries.

## Positive Effects
16. Elixir of Health: Instantly cures any disease affecting the drinker and restores a significant amount of health. Can be sold or given to a patron in need, for reputation or gold increase.

17. Cloak of Whispering Winds: Allows the wearer to understand and speak any language for 24 hours. Can be sold or used for events.

18. Potion of Speed: Temporarily increases the wearer's movement speed tenfold, allowing them to provide lightning fast service. Bonus to tips.

19. Ring of Fire Resistance: Provides the wearer with protection against fire. Useful in monster attacks or cooking accidents. 

20. Goblet of Everwater: Fills with fresh, clean water when commanded, never running dry. Very useful for a tavern.
