# Event Name: Monster Siege

## Event Description:
A sudden commotion alarms the patrons of your tavern as a monster descends upon the village. The type of monster variesâ€”ranging from a mischievous imp to a formidable ogre, each posing a different level of threat to your establishment. As the tavern owner, your primary concern is the safety of your patrons and the preservation of your livelihood. You must quickly decide how to protect your tavern.

## Player Choices:

### Hire Adventurers: 
Spend gold to hire local adventurers who are currently in the tavern to fend off the monster, or attempt to persuade them to do it for free.

### Outsmart the Monster: 
Use your wit to devise a non-violent strategy to deter the monster, relying on clever tricks or negotiation.

### Fortify the Tavern: 
Invest in quick fortifications to minimize damage, hoping to withstand the monster's attack without direct confrontation.

### Do Nothing: 
Accept the loss, allow the monster to cause damage, and hope it won't be too expensive to fix. 

## Choice Outcomes:

## Hire Adventurers:

### Success: 
The adventurers successfully defend the tavern, earning you gratitude from patrons and possibly some recovered loot from the monster.
### Failure: 
Despite your investment, the adventurers are overwhelmed, leading to damage and a loss of gold for repairs.

## Outsmart the Monster:

### Success: 
Your cunning plan works, saving the tavern without resorting to violence. You gain respect and perhaps a curious item left behind by the monster.
### Failure: 
The monster sees through your ploy, causing destruction in its disappointment.

## Fortify the Tavern:

### Partial Success: 
The fortifications reduce damage, but the cost of materials and the sight of barricades may temporarily deter patrons.
### Failure: 
The monster breaks through the defenses, leading to repairs that might exceed the cost of hiring adventurers.

## Do Nothing:

### Lucky Outcome: 
The monster loses interest or is driven away by something else, causing minimal damage.
### Unlucky Outcome: 
The tavern suffers extensive damage, leading to costly repairs and a loss of reputation among the villagers.

## Rewards/Penalties:

Successfully defending the tavern can increase your reputation, attract more patrons, and possibly grant you unique items.
Failure to protect the tavern can result in a loss of gold for repairs, a decrease in patronage due to fear or dissatisfaction, and a damaged reputation.

## Special Considerations:

The choice and outcome of the monster event could open up new storylines or quests, such as tracking down the source of the monster attack or dealing with the consequences of the monster's rampage.

Implement a cooldown period for this event to prevent it from happening too frequently.

Future expansion of mechanics could allow players to prepare in advance for monster attacks, by hiring permanent guards or fortifying defenses.
