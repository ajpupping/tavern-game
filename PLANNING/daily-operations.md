# Simplified Daily Operations System

## Core Mechanic:
Players draw "order cards" representing patrons' food and drink requests. After fulfilling an order, the player rolls a digital dice to determine the outcome (e.g., success, failure, or exceptional service).

## Implementation Steps:

## Order Cards:

Design a set of order cards that includes a variety of common tavern foods and drinks. Each card specifies what the patron has ordered.

Players draw a card to see the patron's order and "fulfill" it by acknowledging it's been served (e.g., clicking a button).

## Roll for Outcome:

After acknowledging an order, players roll a digital dice to determine the outcome of serving that order:
1-2: The food is burned or the drink is spilled, leading to no gold earned and a slight reputation hit.
3-4: The order is served correctly, earning the standard gold for that order.
5: The service is good, earning a little extra gold.
6: The guest is exceptionally pleased, leaving a big tip and a small boost to the tavern's reputation.

## Inventory Checks (Optional):

Optionally, before fulfilling an order, a simple check could ensure that the tavern has the necessary ingredients or items in stock. If not, the player can't fulfill the order until they restock.
Restocking could involve a simple gold deduction to simulate purchasing more supplies.

## Gameplay Loop:

This process repeats, with players drawing order cards, fulfilling orders, and rolling for outcomes. This allows players to earn gold and manage their tavern's reputation in between major events.

## Visual and Interactive Elements:

Use straightforward visuals for order cards, making it clear what each order is. Digital dice rolling can be animated to add a fun, interactive element.
Provide feedback on the outcome (e.g., a short description or icon showing if the order was a success, a failure, or exceptionally well-received).

## Balancing and Progression:

Balance gold earnings and reputation impacts to make sure this mechanic is rewarding but not overly punitive.

Consider introducing rare order cards that are harder to fulfill but offer higher rewards, adding variety and a chance for greater earnings.
